# traptrap

How difficult is it to create award-winning rap verses? While the contributors to this repo don't claim to have the voice or branding to make it to the Grammys, we'll try to write scripts that can approximate a decent rap verse. 


The inspiration for the name of this project comes from the Migos' immortal words: 

*Up early in the morning trappin' (trap trap)*
